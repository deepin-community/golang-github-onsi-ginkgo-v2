.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Ginkgo is a BDD-style Golang testing framework built to help you efficiently
write expressive and comprehensive tests.

This page documents the
.B ginkgo
CLI, which offers a number of conveniences beyond what \fBgo test\fR provides out
of the box and its usage is recommended, but not necessary.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 4
\fBginkgo\fR or \fBginkgo run\fR \fIflags\fR \fIpackages\fR -- \fIpass-throughs\fR
Run the tests in \fIpackages\fR (or the package in the current directory).

Any arguments after \fB--\fR will be passed to the test.
Run \fBginkgo help run\fR for a description of all valid flags.

.TP 4
\fBginkgo\fR watch \fIflags\fR \fIpackages\fR -- \fIpass-throughs\fR
Watches the files in  \fIpackages\fR and re-runs tests when changes occur.

.TP 4
\fBginkgo\fR bootstrap \fIflags\fR
Bootstrap a test suite for the current package

.TP 4
\fBginkgo\fR generate \fIfilenames\fR
Generate a test file named \fIfilename\fR_test.go

If the optional \fIfilenames\fR argument is omitted, a file named after the
package in the current directory will be created.

.TP 4
\fBginkgo\fR labels \fIflags\fR \fIpackages\fR
List labels detected in the passed-in packages (or the package in the current directory).

.TP 4
